# Embed Google Photos


How do I display a single Photo from Google photos?

How do I display a Filtered List of Albums?

How do I filter Images?

How do I filter Videos?

I would like to know if it’s possible to use this plugin with Elementor? 

And what’s the code to exclude a specific album from appearing

#Can I change "load more" button settings? E.g. show all images from folder without "load more" button.

I got this plug in to work, but is it possible to display an album that is in a different user's Google account?

Alternatively, is it possible to display an album shared with the main Google Account that is signed in to the app?
